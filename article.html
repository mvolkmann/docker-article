    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The primary appeal of using Docker is that
      "Dockerized" apps can run anywhere.
      This includes Windows, Mac, and Linux.
      Each platform must install Docker.
      Applications run in a virtual Linux environment.
      Many Linux variants are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common use of Docker is to run server software.
      For example, it could be used to run a web server or a REST server.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a high level, the steps involved in using Docker include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a file named <code>DockerFile</code> that describes an "image".</li>
      <li>Build the image.</li>
      <li>Run the image in a "container".</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Installing Docker</h3>

    <h4>Installing in Windows</h4>
    <p>
      The steps are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Browse <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/</a>.</li>
      <li>Scroll to and click "Get Docker for Windows (stable)" to download a <code>.msi</code> file.</li>
      <li>Double-click the downloaded .msi file and follow the instructions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Installing in macOS</h4>
    <p>
      The steps are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Browse <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/</a>.</li>
      <li>Scroll to and click "Get Docker for Mac (stable)" to download a .dmg file.</li>
      <li>Double-click the download <code>.dmg</code> file.</li>
      <li>In the install dialog, drag Docker.app to the Applications folder.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is also possible to install Docker in macOS using Homebrew,
      but it requires more steps.  See
      <a href="https://nickcharlton.net/posts/docker-via-homebrew.html" target="_blank">https://nickcharlton.net/posts/docker-via-homebrew.html</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing in Linux</h4>
    <p>
      Instructions vary based on the Linux distribution being used.
      See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Verifying the installation</h4>
    <p>
      The easiest way to verify that the installation was successful
      is to download and run the "hello-world" image.
      To do this enter: <code>docker run hello-world</code>.
      This will download the image, and output
      information related to the download,
      the line "<code>Hello from Docker!</code>",
      and information to help you get started using Docker.
      It also results in creation of an image and a container.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the new image enter: <code>docker images</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the new container enter: <code>docker ps -a</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the container again enter: <code>docker start -a {container-id-prefix}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To get help on a docker command enter: <code>docker help {command}</code>.
      For example, <code>docker help start</code>
      briefly describes the -a option.
      It is used to attach to an existing container.
    </p>

    <h3>Docker images</h3>
    <p>
      A Docker image is a filesystem and
      a set of parameters to use at runtime.
      It doesn't have state and never changes.
      Images can run a set of commands and exit,
      but more commonly they continue running until stopped.
      Examples include web servers, REST servers, and database daemons.
      An image runs inside a container.
    </p>
    <p>
      Images are described by and built from files
      that, by convention, are named "<code>Dockerfile</code>".
      When building an image, the <code>-f</code> option
      of the <code>docker build</code> commmand
      can be specified to use a file with a different name.
    </p>

    <h3>Official Base Images</h3>
    <p>
      Some images are labelled as "official".
      For details on what this means, see
      <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/official-images" target="_blank">https://github.com/docker-library/official-images</a>.
      For a list of the official images, sorted on the number of times they have been "pulled", see
      <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore/" target="_blank">https://hub.docker.com/explore/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official programming language images include
      clojure, elixir, erlang, haskell, ibmjava, julia,
      gcc, golang, java, jruby, node, openjdk, perl,
      php, python, ruby, and swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official web server images include
      glassfish, httpd (Apache), jetty, nginx, and tomcat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official database images include
      cassandra, couchbase, couchdb, mariadb, mongo, mongoexpress,
      mysql, neo4j, oraclelinux, postgres, redis, and rethinkdb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official Linux images include
      debian, centos, fedora, opensuse, and ubuntu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other official images of note include
      bash, drupal, hello-world, jenkins, maven, rails,
      redmine, and wordpress.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>
      Before diving into details about Docker, let's walk through some simple examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should only have one image now.
      That is the one created while verifying the installation.
      Verify this by running <code>docker images</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Bash example</h4>
    <p>
      Let's create a very simple image that just outputs "Hello, World!" using bash.
      Here is the Dockerfile that describes the image.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
FROM bash
CMD echo Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>
      To build this image enter: <code>docker build -t my-demo .</code><br>
      Because we didn't already have the <code>bash</code> base image,
      that was downloaded and built.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see all the current images enter: <code>docker images</code><br>
      We should have three images now.  They are
      <code>hello-world</code>, <code>bash,</code> and <code>my-demo</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the <code>my-demo</code> image enter: <code>docker run my-demo</code><br>
      This runs the image in a newly created container.
      The container still exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see this enter: <code>docker ps -a</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To run this container again enter: <code>docker run -a {container-id}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete this container enter: <code>docker rm {container-id-prefix}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete the <code>my-demo</code> image enter: <code>docker rmi my-demo</code><br>
      Note that the <code>bash</code> image on which it depended was not deleted,
      but it can be deleted with <code>docker rmi bash</code>.
      It is common to create multiple images that use the same base image
      and retain these rather than delete them.
    </p>

    <h4>Node example</h4>
    <p>
      Now let's create an image that outputs "<code>Hello, World!</code>" using Node.js.
      It uses the "chalk" npm package to output colored text.
      We are doing this to illustrate using npm packages from a Docker image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the <code>package.json</code> file that describes dependencies.
      It can also specify a "script" for running the application.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
{
  "name": "chalk-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a Hello World app that uses the chalk npm package",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "chalk": "^1.1.3"
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Here is the JavaScript code from the file <code>index.js</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: javascript">
const chalk = require('chalk');

// process.argv holds command-line arguments.
// The first value is the path to the node executable.
// The second value is the path to the file being executed.
// The third value (at index 2) is the first command-line argument.
const name = process.argv[2] || process.env.name || 'World';
console.log('Hello, ' + chalk.red.bold(name) + '!');</pre>

    <p>
      To run this Node application outside of Docker
      with no excess output from npm,
      enter: <code>npm -s start</code>
      Note how "World" is output in red.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the Dockerfile that describes the image to be built.
      It specifies a specific version of Node, 7.4.
      An alternative it to request the latest long-term support (LTS) version
      by replacing the version number with the code name "boron".
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
FROM node:7.4-onbuild
ENV name ""
CMD ["npm", "--silent", "start"]</pre>

    <p>
      Base images with an "<code>onbuild"</code> tag
      use <code>ONBUILD</code> instructions to specify
      instructions to be executed when the using image is executed.
      These instructions are executed as if were inserted
      immediately after the FROM instruction.
      In the case of node onbuild images, the following
      happens automatically when the image is executed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assume the current directory contains a <code>package.json</code> file.</li>
      <li>Run <code>npm install</code> which installs the dependencies
        described in <code>package.json</code>.</li>
      <li>Assume <code>package.json</code> defines
        a <code>start</code> script.</li>
      <li>Run <code>npm start</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The CMD instruction in the Dockerfile above overrides the one provided
      by the <code>node onbuild</code> image to use the <code>--silent</code> option.
      This suppresses informational messages from npm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To build the Docker image enter: <code>docker build -t node-demo .</code><br>
      This will take several minutes because it needs to
      download and build the <code>node</code> base image.
      Once the base image has been built, rebuilding this image,
      or other images that use the same base image,
      will build much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run this image, but not retain the container in which it runs,
      enter: <code>docker run -t --rm node-demo</code><br>
      The <code>-t</code> option tells Docker to run the image in a pseudo-TTY
      which is able to process the ANSI escape codes
      output by the <code>chalk</code> package to produce colored text.
      The <code>--rm</code> option tells Docker not to retain
      the container it creates after the image exits.
      Note that it is preceded by two dashes, not one.
    </p>
    <p>
      To override the value of the <code>name</code> environment variable
      specified in <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>index.js</code>,
      add "<code>-e name={value}</code>" to the <code>docker run</code> command.
      For example, <code>docker run -t --rm -e name=Mark node-demo</code>
    </p>

    <h4>Volume example</h4>
    <p>
      Now let's create an image that writes and reads files on the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the <code>package.json</code> file.
      This example has no dependencies.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
{
  "name": "volume-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "demonstrates reading and writing text files",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}</pre>

    <p>
      Here is the JavaScript code from the file <code>index.js</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: javascript">
const fs = require('fs');
const filePath = '/data/test.txt';

const data = 'Hello, World!';
fs.writeFile(filePath, data, err => {
  if (err) throw err;

  console.log('write was successful');

  fs.readFile(filePath, (err, buf) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('read got:', buf.toString());
  });
});</pre>

    <p>
      Here is the Dockerfile that describes the image to be built.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
FROM node:7.4-onbuild
CMD ["npm", "start"]
</pre>

    <p>
      To build the Docker image enter: <code>docker build -t volume-demo .</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      To run this image,
      enter: <code>docker run --rm -v $HOME/data:/data volume-demo</code><br>
      The <code>-v</code> option tells Docker to
      map the container directory <code>/data</code>
      to the host directory <code>data</code>
      under your home directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      After running this, a file named <code>test.txt</code> will exist
      in <code>$HOME/data</code> directory and it will contain
      "<code>Hello, World!</code>".
    </p>

    <h4>Express example</h4>
    <p>
      Now let's create an image that runs an Express HTTP server using Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the <code>package.json</code> file that describes dependencies.
      It also specifies a <code>script</code> for running the application.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
{
  "name": "express-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a Hello World Express app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.14.0"
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Here is the JavaScript code from the file <code>index.js</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: javascript">
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  const name = req.query.name || 'World';
  res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log('listening on port', port));</pre>

    <p>
      To run this Node application outside of Docker
      enter: <code>npm start</code><br>
      and browse <code>localhost:3000/hello?name={your-first-name}</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the <code>Dockerfile</code> that describes the image to be built.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
FROM node:7.4-onbuild
EXPOSE 3000</pre>
    <p>
      To build this image enter: <code>docker build -t express-demo .</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a container exposes ports using the EXPOSE instruction,
      these ports are only available to processes running in the container.
      To use them outside of the container (in the host),
      they must be mapped to a host port.
      This is specified with the <code>--publish</code> or <code>-p</code> option.
      For example, <code>-p 3001:3000</code> specifies that port 3000
      inside the container is mapped to the host port 3001.
      The same port number can be used for both if
      the container port isn't already in use on the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run this image in a container enter:
      <code>docker run -d -p 3000:3000 express-demo</code><br>
      The <code>-d</code> option causes the container
      to run in the background (detached mode).
      Do not include the <code>--rm</code> option when using this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To output log messages from container enter:
      <code>docker logs {container-id-prefix}</code><br>
      This is a great way to diagnose issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a container is not running in detached mode, it cannot be
      stopped by pressing ctrl-c in the terminal where it is running.
      To stop a running container enter:
      <code>docker stop {container-id-prefix}</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon EC2</h3>
    <p>
      From the Amazon EC2 website,
      "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service
      that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
      It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next section we will walk through the steps to
      run a Docker image in a container within an EC2 instance.
      To prepare for that, this section provides the steps
      to create a free EC2 account.
      Skip the rest of this section if you already have an EC2 account.
    </p>

    </ol>
    <p>
      The next step is to get access and secret keys.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the "My Account" menu in the upper-right,
        select "Security Credentials".</li>
      <li>Sign in using your new account.</li>
      <li>Press the "Continue to Security Credentials" button.</li>

      <li>Press the "Create New Access Key" button.</li>
      <li>Press the "Download New Key" button.</li>
      <li>This downloads a file named "rootkey.csv" in the Downloads directory.
        It contains your access key and secret key.
        Move this file to a place you'll remember to look for it later,
        like in a directory named "Amazon-AWS".</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Docker Machine</h3>
    <p>
      Docker Machine makes it easy to use Docker in cloud provider instances.
      We'll walk through the steps to create an instance on Amazon EC2.
      This section assumes you already have an AWS account.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Install Docker Machine by following the instructions at
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Docker-aware Amazon EC2 instance
        by entering the following commands.
        We will use the instance name "aws-sandbox".
        That should be substituted in place of all occurrences of
        {instance-name} below.<br>
        <code>
        docker-machine create --driver amazonec2 \<br>
          --amazonec2-access-key={access-key} \<br>
          --amazonec2-secret-key={secret-key} \<br>
          --amazonec2-region={region} \<br>
          {instance-name}
        </code><br>
        The values for <code>access-key</code> and <code>secret-key</code>
        can be obtained from the <code>rootkey.csv</code> file
        that was downloaded in the previous section.
        The value for region will be similar to "us-west-2".</li>
        This command populates the
        <code>~/.docker/machine/machines/{instance-name}</code> directory
        with several <code>.pem</code> files and more.
        It will take several minutes to complete.
      </li>
      <li>Enter: <code>eval $(docker-machine env {instance-name})</code><br>
        This sets four Docker-related environment variables that cause
        subsequent "<code>docker</code>" commands to run on the AWS instance
        instead of locally.
        The environment variables are <code>DOCKER_CERT_PATH</code>,
        <code>DOCKER_HOST</code>, <code>DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME</code>,
        and <code>DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY</code>.
        Unset these environment variables later
        to return to using Docker locally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To list the current Docker Machine instances enter:
      <code>docker-machine ls</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the IP address of an instance enter:
      <code>docker-machine ip {instance-name}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the normal docker commands to build images
      and run them in containers within the AWS instance.
      For example, to build and run our <code>express-demo</code>,
      cd to its directory and enter these commands:<br>
      <code>docker build -t express-demo .</code><br>
      <code>docker run -d -p 3000:3000 express-demo</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      To test this app running in the AWS instance,
      browse <code>http://{instance-ip-address}:3000/hello</code>.
      TODO: Why doesn't the server respond?
    </p>
    <p>
      To stop a running instance enter
      <code>docker-machine stop {instance-name}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To restart a running instance enter
      <code>docker-machine restart {instance-name}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To remove a stopped instance enter
      <code>docker-machine remove {instance-name}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To ssh into an instance enter:
      <code>docker-machine ssh {instance-name}</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Dockerfile contents</h3>
    <p>
      Dockerfiles contain instructions that describe an image to be built.
      Each instruction is on a separate line.
      They start with an instruction name followed by its arguments.
      Instruction names are not case sensitive, but
      the convention is for them to be all uppercase.
      To spread arguments over several lines,
      end all but the last line with a backslash like in Bash.
      Comments are lines that begin with <code>#</code>.
      Comments cannot appear at the ends of instructions.
    </p>

    <h3>Dockerfile instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Each instruction runs independently in a new image created just for it,
      or ones from previous builds that are in the "build cache".
      Previous commands do not affect subsequent ones.
      For example, "RUN cd /usr/local" will not change
      the working directory used by the next instruction.
    </p>

    <h4>FROM</h4>
    <p>
      This specifies the base image.
      It is required and MUST be the first instruction.
    </p>

    <h4>ENV</h4>
    <p>
      This instruction sets the value of an environment variable
      that is used inside the Dockerfile.
      It cannot be used to change the value
      of a previously set environment variable.
      For example, to set ANIMAL to GIRAFFE,
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
ENV animal giraffe</pre>
    <p>
      To refer to this enviroment variable in another instruction,
      use <code>${ANIMAL}</code> or <code>$ANIMAL</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructions that support references to environment variables include:
      <code>ADD</code>, <code>COPY</code>, <code>ENV</code>, <code>EXPOSE</code>,
      <code>LABEL</code>, <code>ONBUILD</code>, <code>STOPSIGNAL</code>,
      <code>USER</code>, <code>VOLUME</code>, and <code>WORKDIR</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>MAINTAINER</h4>

    <h4>WORKDIR</h4>
    <p>
      This sets the default working directory from which commands will execute.
      It defaults to "/".
    </p>

    <h4>RUN</h4>

    <h4>CMD</h4>

    <h4>PATH</h4>
    <p>
      This specifies a local filesystem path that will be in the context of the image.
      This should expose only the files needed by the image.
      For example, do not use /.
      A .dockerignore file can be added to any directory
      to specify files that should not be exposed to the image.
    </p>

    <h4>URL</h4>
    <p>
      This specifies a Github repository whose files will be in the context of the image.
    </p>

    <h4>COPY</h4>

    <h4>WORKPATH</h4>

    <h3>Base images</h3>
    <p>
      TODO:
    </p>

    <h4>Creating images</h4>
    <p>
      To build an image from a Dockerfile:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker build [-t {tag}] {Dockerfile-path}</pre>
    <p>
      While the -t option can be omitted, it is preferable include it.
      Otherwise the image can only be identified by
      the id that is automatically assigned.
      A tag consists of a name and an an optional version separated from the name by a colon.
      For example, <code>my-project:1.2</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically the "docker build" command is run
      from the directory that contains Dockerfile.
      When that is the case, the value for Dockerfile-path
      can be a period representing the current directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the base image identified in Dockerfile does not already
      exist locally, its Dockerfile is downloaded from
      <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.
      Docker Hub is a repository of shared Docker images.
      Next, the base image built.
      The time required to do this depends on the base image,
      but it is typically several minutes.
      Subsequent builds of your images that use these base images
      are much faster because locally installed base images are reused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of commonly used base images include
      bash and node.  ADD MORE!
    </p>

    <h4>Listing existing images</h4>
    <p>
      To get a list of all exising images:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker images</pre>

    <h4>Tagging images</h4>
    <p>
      Images have unique ids which are SHA values.
      These are long and difficult to type.
      Tags are human readable aliases for image ids.
      Any number of tags can be added to the same image.
      To add a tag to an image:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker tag {id-or-existing-name} {new-name}</pre>

    <h4>Deleting images</h4>
    <p>
      To delete an image:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker rmi [-f] {image-id-prefix-or-tag}</pre>
    <p>
      If an image has a tag other than "latest",
      deleting it requires specifying both the name and tag like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      If the image is used by an existing container,
      an error message explaining this will be output.
      The image can be deleted anyway if the -f option is used.
      Containers whose images have been deleted can still be rerun
      because all images it requires were copied into it.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker rmi [-f] {name}:{tag}</pre>
    <p>
      There are multiple versions of an image, eash with a different tag,
      deleting one by its id, requires using the -f option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting a tag only deletes the corresponding image
      if it is the only tag for that image. ???
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a bash script that deletes all images.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
#!/bin/bash
# Removes all images.
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)</pre>

    <h4>Dangling images</h4>
    <p>
      During iterative development it is common
      to rebuild an image multiple times.
      When an image with the same name as an existing one is built,
      the previous version remains but is stripped of its name and tag.
      These are referred to as "dangling images".
      The following command deletes all of them:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker rmi $(docker images -qa -f "dangling=true")</pre>
    <p>
      This uses two docker commands.
      First, "docker images" is used to get a list of the ids
      of all the dangling images.
      Second, "docker rmi" is used to delete those images.
      Why isn't there a build option to do this automatically?
    </p>

    <h3>Docker Containers</h3>
    <p>
      A container is a running instance of an image.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating/Running containers</h4>

    <h4>Listing containers</h4>
    <p>
      To list the current running containers,
      enter: <code>docker ps</code>.
      To list all containers including those that are stopped,
      enter: <code>docker ps -a</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Getting container details</h4>
    <p>
      To see details about an existing container,
      enter: <code>docker inspect {container-id}</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Restarting containers</h4>
    <p>
      To restart a container whose image is currently running,
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker restart {container-id}</pre>

    <h4>Rerunning containers</h4>
    <p>
      To rerun a container whose image has exited,
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker start -a {container-id}</pre>
    <p>
      This works even if the images used by the container have been deleted
      because the images have already been copied into the container.
    </p>

    <h4>Deleting containers</h4>
    <p>
      To delete specific containers enter: <code>docker rm {container-ids}</code><br>
      A space-separated list of container id prefixes can be specified.
      Each id prefix must uniquely match a single container.
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete all containers enter: <code>docker rm $(docker ps -qa)</code>
    </p>

    <h4>Opening a shell inside a running container</h4>
    <p>
      To interact with a running container,
      open a shell inside it where commands can be entered.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker exec -it {container-id} /bin/sh</pre>
    <p>
      Here is a bash script that deletes all containers.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
#!/bin/bash
# Removes all containers, including running ones.
docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)</pre>

    <h3>Volumes</h3>
    <p>
      Containers can also provide read-write access to the read-only image filesystem
      a "Union File System".
      Changes to files happens in the container, but are not saved in the image.
      "Volumes" allow these changes to be persisted to the local filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      To specify a volume to be used by a container,
      use the -v option of the docker run command as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: plain">
      docker run {image-name} -v $(pwd):{directory}</pre>
    brush
    <p>
      It should be possible to edit files under a volume directory
      and have the image in the container utilize the changes
      without restarted it.  TRY THIS!

    <h3>Sharing Image</h3>
    <p>
      The easiest way to share a Docker image
      is to share its Dockerfile.
      The recipient can build this image from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another alternative is to register for a
      <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>
      account and upload your image there.
      From here you can browse for shared, downloadable images.
      For example, docker/whalesay.
    </p>
